                    <p>
                        A game made in Unity with the goal of having a digital room for talking to members.
                        The game uses Photon for server hosting and has become a great source of learning for me.
                        Started this project knowing nothing about Unity, watched some tutorials, practiced and went to work.
                        Proud of the skills I've gathered till now. My job was taking care of the main menu and the online aspect.
                        Made with the C# language.

                    <p>
                        In this application employees can login and view or create reservations for rooms.
                        Members can reserve a room for themselves or as a team and the admin can customize all made reservations.
                        I made the admin component, teams creation and the ability to reserve for multiple days at once.
                        Was really happy with the end result.
                        Made using .NET Core MVC with C#. Also made use of a sql database.

                        Using this WinForms application customers can see a list of available and coming soon movies and reserve tickets for it.
                        Reservations are saved in a database. I made the page which displays current and upcoming movies and also added a searchbar.
                        Made using Windows Forms and C# and sql.

                        The app is made using Python and lets you manage the Health of the players and throw a dice.
                        This was my first teamproject and I can say without a doubt that it's not that great. :(
                        Made using Processing.py and Python.
